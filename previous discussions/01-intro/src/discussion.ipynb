    "2. An IDE for developing re-usable and testable python code. Abstracting your notebook code into python library code avoids common mistakes in notoriously error prone notebook environments. Luckily, once a function is in your `.py` file, you can still import/use it in a notebook!\n",

    "\n",
    "* The notebook provides a place to understand the output of your function and test it against your intuition and understanding of what the correct output should be. When working with data, you should always check the correctness of your work using your understanding of that data (i.e. is my conclusion reasonable given what I know about the data?). This is typically the ultimate goal for a problem, so you should *always* interpret your answer on the data in a notebook.\n",

While expressive, notebooks are error-prone, manual, and hard to debug. Moving useful code to a `.py` file makes your code more clear, encourages code reuse, and makes debugging easier. Once you have moved any work from your notebook to a `.py` file, you should check the correctness of your work in two ways:\n",
    "    - Run the doctests. The doctests ensure your code *meets the contract* specified in the question (or by you, in your own projects). That is, is your code expecting the correct inputs and outputs? **Doctests do not check more than if your code is acting on the correct types**.\n",

    "    - **Syntax Errors**: Any syntax errors (e.g. bad code indentation) will cause gradescope to fail (giving a 0 on the assignment). Always double check your code passes doctests *on the commandline* (just as the autograder runs it). Further, pulling your code (from github) onto DataHub and running the tests there is a good debugging technique, as the environment is very similar to gradescope. \n",
    "    - **OOM (out of memory)**: The autograder runs a 1GB server, which is smaller than your computer. Assignments should never require more memory than this; you should think about how to simplify your code!\n",
