Hi, I'm John Chen! I'm currently a 4th year student majoring in Bioinformatics with a minor in Data Science. I found DSC 80 to be the more useful lower division couse and I am excited to be a tutor for DSC 80. My favortite restaurant in San Diego is Meny Ultra, where I can never resist their rich tonkotsu ramen. Looking forward to see you guys in class and office hour!
