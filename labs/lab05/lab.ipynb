Unlike DSC 10, the notebook is *only* for displaying a readable version of your final answers.

    "- **To ensure that all of your work to be submitted is in `lab.py`, we've provided an additional uneditable notebook, called `lab-validation.ipynb`, that contains only the tests and their setup. Make sure you are able to run it top-to-bottom without error before submitting!**\n",

    "First, let's recap the different mechanisms of missingness we studied in lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing by Design (MD)\n",
    "- The missing field is deliberately missing. The missing field is deliberately set to null or not collected (hence, \"missing by design\").\n",
    "- The missingness can be exactly predicted when a column will be null, with only knowledge of the other columns using a function of the rows of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)\n",
    "- The missingness of missing value isn't related to the actual, unreported value itself, nor the values in any other fields. The missingness is not systematic.\n",
    "- The missingness is unconditionally uniform across rows. MCAR doesn't bias the observed data.\n",
    "- There is no relationship between the missing data and the any of the other data, observed or missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing at Random (MAR)\n",
    "- The missingness of the missing value has nothing to do with the value itself, but may be related to another field.\n",
    "- The missingness is uniform across rows, perhaps conditional on another column. MAR biases the observed data, but is fixable.\n",
    "- There is a systematic relationship between the missing values and the observed data (but not the missing values themselves).\n",
    "- Difference between MD and MAR: If you can *exactly/always* determine missingness using the other columns, the missingness is MD. If there is just some sort of systematic relationship between the missing columns/values and other columns/values that may help us predict missingness, the missingness is MAR.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Not Missing At Random (NMAR)\n",
    "- The missingness of the missing value is related to the actual, unreported value.\n",
    "- NMAR biases the observed data in unobservable ways.\n",
    "- There is relationship between the propensity of a value to be missing and its value."

    "### Question 6 ‚Äì Probabilistic Imputation üé≤\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Lecture 8](https://dsc80.com/resources/lectures/lec08/lec08.html), you learned how to impute a quantitative column by sampling from the observed values. **One problem with this technique is that the imputation will never generate imputed values that weren't already in the dataset.** For example, 57, 57.5, and 59 are values in the `'child'` column of `new_heights` while 58 is not. Thus, any imputation done by sampling from the observed values in the `'child'` column will not be able to generate a height of 58, even though it's clearly a reasonable value to occur in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep things simple, you will impute the `'child'` column **unconditionally** from the distribution of `'child'` heights present in the dataset. This means that you will use the values present in `'child'` to impute missing values, without looking at other columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "An approach to quantitative imputation that overcomes the limitation mentioned above is as follows:\n",
    "- Create a histogram of observed `'child'` heights, using 10 bins.\n",
    "- Use the histogram to generate a number within the observed range of `'child'` heights:\n",
    "    - The likelihood a generated number belongs to a given bin is equal to the area of that bin. (Remember, in histograms, areas are proportions.)\n",
    "    - Any number within a fixed bin is equally likely to occur.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Let's illustrate this approach with an example. Let `demo` be the array of 10 numbers defined below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "demo = np.array([10, 11, 11, 13, 14, 14, 13.5, 14, 15, 16])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first step is creating a histogram of `demo`. Note that with this small dataset, we will use 3 bins, but you will be using 10 bins in your imputation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='imgs/demo_histogram.png' width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Note that in your process, you don't actually need to draw a histogram ‚Äì instead, use `np.histogram`.\n",
    "- In the histogram above, we see that $2 \\cdot 0.15 = 0.3 = 30\\%$ of values lie in the [10, 12) bin, $2 \\cdot 0.1 = 0.2 = 20\\%$ of values lie in the [12, 14) bin, and $2 \\cdot 0.25 = 0.5 = 50\\%$ of values lie in the [14, 16] bin.\n",
    "- Next, we need to pick a bin at random. There's a 30\\% chance we pick the [10, 12) bin, a 20\\% chance we pick the [12, 14) bin, and a 50\\% chance we pick the [14, 16] bin. `np.random.choice` will be helpful in picking a bin at random.\n",
    "- Once we pick a bin, we pick a number **uniformly at random** from within the bin. For instance, suppose we randomly chose the [14, 16] bin in the previous step. We then must select a (real) number between 14 and 16 uniformly at random. `np.random.uniform` can help you here.\n",
