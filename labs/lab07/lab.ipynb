    "Welcome to the seventh lab assignment in DSC 80 this quarter!\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like in DSC 10, this Jupyter Notebook contains the statements of the problems and provides code and Markdown cells to display your answers to the problems. Unlike DSC 10, the notebook is *only* for displaying a readable version of your final answers. The coding will be done in an accompanying `lab.py` file that is imported into the current notebook, and **you will only submit that `lab.py` file**, not this notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional guidelines:\n",
    "- **Unlike in DSC 10, labs will have both public tests and hidden tests.** The bulk of your grade will come from your scores on hidden tests, which you will only see on Gradescope after the assignment deadline.\n",
    "- **Do not change the function names in the `lab.py` file!** The functions in the `lab.py` file are how your assignment is graded, and they are graded by their name. If you changed something you weren't supposed to, you can find the original code in the [course GitHub repository](https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc80-2023-fa).\n",
    "- Notebooks are nice for testing and experimenting with different implementations before designing your function in your `lab.py` file. You can write code here, but make sure that all of your real work is in the `lab.py` file, since that's all you're submitting.\n",
    "- **To ensure that all of your work to be submitted is in `lab.py`, we've provided an additional uneditable notebook, called `lab-validation.ipynb`, that contains only the tests and their setup. Make sure you are able to run it top-to-bottom without error before submitting!**\n",
    "- You are encouraged to write your own additional helper functions to solve the lab, as long as they also end up in `lab.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importing code from `lab.py`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Below, we import the `.py` file that's contained in the same directory as this notebook.\n",
    "* We use the `autoreload` notebook extension to make changes to our `lab.py` file immediately available in our notebook. Without this extension, we would need to restart the notebook kernel to see any changes to `lab.py` in the notebook.\n",
    "    - `autoreload` is necessary because, upon import, `lab.py` is compiled to bytecode (in the directory `__pycache__`). Subsequent imports of `lab` merely import the existing compiled python."
